# Apartment Searching App 

This app is dedicated for searching apartments for rent based on location and other preferences. This app takes the help of google maps for location based services. NodeJS is used in back end and Bootstrap and jQuery on front. MongoDB is used as data storage. Both front and back is Dockerized, Docker-Compose is used to bring up the containers and network between them. Port 3000 and 80 are open for outside communication. It can be reached using localhost. 

Please use up.bat to bring all the containers. 

Users who doesn't want to download the entire source code can copy the contents of khoj.bat, running which will download the prebuilt images from docker hub.

cleanup can be used to tear down the system.

Thank you.
